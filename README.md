This repository contains the data set used, the model(s), tests, the results, and the graphing code.

Dataset: Temepartures from DIVINER, inputs from variety of work
Model: Thermal model and outputs for diffusion into the subsurface, migration model
Tests: To check how models handle extremes, weird inputs, if they are physical/realistic
Results: We will see what happens!
Graphing code and figures:
